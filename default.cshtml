<h1>A file-only concept/sandbox super simple "CMS" using Razor syntax and some simple conventions</h1>

<p>Use all Razor techniques for easy layouts, sections, partial page contents, helpers a.s.o
The only thing this "CMS" adds is a small NavigationNode class which can build a navigation node tree from the 
filesystem. Then you can use the navigation node tree to display html navigation with some simple Razor 
functions (sample top navigation and sub navigation included)</p>

<p>Folders and files with .cshtml extenstions will show in the navigation (sets the VisibleInNavigation property to 
true).</p>

<p>This sample runs from github (free account) https://github.com/joeriks/NavigationNode and autodeploy to 
AppHarbor (free account 1 instance) http://navigationnode.apphb.com/
Which basically means I can edit the razor files on GitHub, and on save they are committed and automatically 
deployed to the site, which I think is pretty cool.</p>
